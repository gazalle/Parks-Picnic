# Parks-Picnic
A backend application for people who wants to go to picnic. 


To start the app run following command:
npm run start-dev

When you run the application, it will display Parks when you click Parks then its accossiated Picnic Groups will be displayed. Each group can be seen further by clicking the group itself. Detailed informations include items and also joining options. It is also possible to add a group to related park. 

App could be further improved like displaying Parks according to their distances and adding new items to selected group. 

Note: I added extra challange to the challange. I am learning React these days so I tried to solve the challange with React library.
